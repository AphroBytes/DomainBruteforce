# Welcome to DomainBruteforce!

Hi! I've created this little script with the intention of finding a available short domain for personal use. Just get yourself a API key for the [Domaination.io](https://english.api.rakuten.net/moneals/api/domaination-io) API into the api_key variable in the script and it's ready to be used. 

I recommend you to play around with the top level domain, the bruteforce length and the maximum count of different chars in the domain.
